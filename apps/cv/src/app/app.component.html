                I'm eager to find solutions to challenging tasks in every field of Software Engineering and also like to
                take part in the company's cultural tasks. During my work I try to find the best solution in the given

                Full Stack systems written in Javascript. (NodeJS, Angular) I designed and developed SOA and regular
                REST based systems as well, written in NodeJS.
